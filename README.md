## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - Angular framework

### Continued development

Although I write most of my code in React framework, I've done this one in Angular to practise something different and to remember some of Angular patterns, I've used to learn in the past.

### Useful resources

- [ngFor resources](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/angular-basics-introduction-ngfor-directive-angular?kw=&cpn=13466528117&&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-angular-trial-search-bms-EMEA&ad_group=Angular+DSA&utm_term=DYNAMIC+SEARCH+ADS&ad_copy=&ad_type=search_DSA&ad_size=DSA3_blazor-dsa_D1-build-professional-ui-with-a-popular-collection-of-100+-native-angular-components&ad_placement=&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIm-Lt_Nq18wIVBJiyCh3vuwlWEAAYASAAEgLqVfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) - This helped me with using ngFor loop. Although I was using ngFor in the past, it was some time ago and I didn't know how to get to the single element of looped Array. It helped me put in the right place, rates and users opinions components.
